    "# Desktop Usage and Caching\n",
    "\n",
    "WebDataset is an ideal solution for training on petascale datasets kept on high performance distributed data stores like AIStore, AWS/S3, and Google Cloud. Compared to data center GPU servers, desktop machines have much slower network connections, but training jobs on desktop machines often also use much smaller datasets. WebDataset also is very useful for such smaller datasets, and it can easily be used for developing and testing on small datasets and then scaling up to large datasets by simply using more shards.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are different usage scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "| environment | caching strategy |\n",
    "|-|-|\n",
    "| cloud training against cloud buckets | use WebDataset directly with cloud URLs |\n",
    "| on premises training with high performance store (e.g., AIStore) | use WebDataset directly with storage URLs. |\n",
    "| prototyping, development, testing for large scale training | copy a few shards to local disk OR use automatic shard caching OR use DBCache |\n",
    "| on premises training with slower object stores/networks | use automatic shard caching or DBCache for entire dataset |\n",
    "| desktop deep learning, smaller dataset | copy all shards to disk manually OR use automatic shard caching |\n",
    "| training with IterableDataset sources other than WebDataset | use DBCache |\n",
    "\n",
    "_The upshot is: you can write a single I/O pipeline that works for both local and remote data, and for both small and large datasets, and you can fine-tune performance and take advantage of local storage by adding the `cache_dir` and `DBCache` options._\n",
