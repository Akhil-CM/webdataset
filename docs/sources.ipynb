    "The `ShardList` class takes either a string or a list of URLs as an argument. If it is given a string, the string is expanded using the `braceexpand` library. So, the following are equivalent:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "ShardList(\"dataset-{000..001}.tar\")\n",
    "ShardList([\"dataset-000.tar\", \"dataset-001.tar\"])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The url strings in a shard list are handled by default by the `webdataset.url_opener` filter. It recognizes three simple kinds of strings: \"-\", \"/path/to/file\", and \"pipe:command\":\n",
    "\n",
    "- the string \"-\", referring to stdin\n",
    "- a UNIX path, opened as a regular file\n",
    "- a URL-like string with the schema \"pipe:\"; such URLs are opened with `subprocess.Popen`. For example:\n",
    "    - `pipe:curl -s -L http://server/file` accesses a file via HTTP\n",
    "    - `pipe:gsutil cat gs://bucket/file` accesses a file on GCS\n",
    "    - `pipe:az cp --container bucket --name file --file /dev/stdout` accesses a file on Azure\n",
    "    - `pipe:ssh host cat file` accesses a file via `ssh`\n",
    "\n",
    "It might seem at first glance to be \"more efficient\" to use built-in Python libraries for accessing object stores rather than subprocesses, but efficient object store access from Python really requires spawning a separate process anyway, so this approach to accessing object stores is not only convenient, it also is as efficient as we can make it in Python."
